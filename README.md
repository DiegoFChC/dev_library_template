# Documentation template

This is a basic documentation template developed with Next.js. This allows you to share your application documentation or share your own notes with others.

[Demo](https://dev-library-template.vercel.app/)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Tools

The main tools used to develop this template are:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [MarkDoc](https://markdoc.dev/) - a powerful, flexible, Markdown-based authoring framework.
